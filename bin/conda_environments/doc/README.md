# Setting up the Conda Environment

## Installing with Windows or Mac 
0. Open your terminal. We recommend Anaconda Prompt for Windows and Terminal for Mac
1. Change to a directory where you want to save your Conda Environment
    - From the root directory of this repository, we recommend doing `cd ./bin/conda_environments/env`
2. Copy and paste the commands one line at a time from this file into your terminal: 
    - [../../../bin/conda_environments/doc/med_pc_env_for_bash.sh](../../../bin/conda_environments/doc/med_pc_env_for_bash.sh)

## Installing with Linux
- Run all the commands from the root directory of the repository(named med_pc_repo) with:
    - `cd {path_to}/med_pc_repo`
        - Replace `{path_to}` with the parent directories of 
    - `./bin/conda_environments/doc/med_pc_env_for_bash.sh`
